pysudoku
========

Python script that reads in Sudoku puzzles in jSON format and solves them using a simple backtracking algorithm.

This repository includes a hardest_sudoku.json I found on the internet which can be solved by this script using
the following command:-
python sudoku.py hardest_sudoku.json

I developed this script simply because I had nothing to do one weekend. The script was not written with long term
maintainability in mind and is therefore not commented at all.
